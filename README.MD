# WHID Misc

Here are a collection of useful files for the use with WHID injector. Tutorials are in french, and the keymap here is the one to use with malduinos that will be plugged into devices configured to use AZERTY.

I created this repo after having a hard time finding a keymap for my malduino devices which supported backslashes.
