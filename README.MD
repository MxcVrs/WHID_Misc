# WHID Misc

Here are a collection of useful files for the use with WHID injector. Tutorials are in french, and the keymap here is the one to use with malduinos that will be plugged into devices configured to use AZERTY.

I created this repo after having a hard time finding a keymap for my malduino devices which supported backslashes.

"WHID Injector.pdf" is a tutorial on how to flash an AZERTY firmware on your WHID Injector. It also works for other types of malduino devices such as ones built on the basis of an Arduino Leonardo.
